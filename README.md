# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

**Kody here.** I'm an iOS developer, keyboard collector, and long-time Apple software enthusiast. I'm a big fan of Point-Free libraries and tools, and I love building modular, maintainable apps with Swift.

I've been into tech for as long as I can remember. Back in the day, I was the kid jailbreaking iPod Touches and exploring Cydia just to see what was possible. That early curiosity sparked a lifelong love of software and programming.

Since college, Iâ€™ve been building iOS apps and having a blast doing it. I enjoy crafting thoughtful codebases, learning new frameworks, and shipping features that are both useful and delightful to use.

Outside of work, I'm passionate about mentorship and developer community. I regularly attend meetups, try to connect with other developers, and give workshops when I can. I believe in sharing what I know, learning from others, and always staying curious.
