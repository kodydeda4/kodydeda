# 👋 Hi, I'm Kody Deda

iOS developer, mechanical keyboard nerd, and long-time Apple software enthusiast.

## 🧠 My Story

I’ve been into tech for as long as I can remember — back in the day, I was that kid jailbreaking iPod Touches and hunting down Cydia tweaks just to see what was possible. That curiosity quickly turned into a love for Apple software and programming in general.

Since college, I’ve been building iOS apps and having a blast doing it. I love crafting thoughtful, modular codebases, learning new frameworks, and shipping real features that people can actually use.

## 🛠 What I’m Into

- Writing clean, scalable iOS apps in **Swift**, **SwiftUI**, **TCA**, and **Swift Concurrency**
- Collecting mechanical keyboards — favorites include the **IBM Model M**, **Kinesis Advantage 360**, and **Apple Keyboard Extended II**
- Mentorship and knowledge-sharing — helping others grow helps me grow
- Building cool software with fun, kind, curious people
- Connecting with developers at meetups, workshops, and over coffee
